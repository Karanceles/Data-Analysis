- NumPy Arrays
- Generating random numbers with NumPy
- Vectorized operations
- Linear algebra
- Broadcasting (Forecasting)

Given the properties of Python, NumPy is pretty useful for scientific purpouses.
Through the application of linear algebra, we'll be able to forecast and predict certain behaviours, which is a powerful mechanic.
